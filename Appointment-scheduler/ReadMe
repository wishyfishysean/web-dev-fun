# 📅 Simple Appointment Scheduler

A lightweight appointment scheduling website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and a bit of **JavaScript**.  
No frameworks, no backend — just pure front-end logic and localStorage.

---

## ✨ What It Does
- 🧍 Add appointments by entering **name**, **date**, and **time**  
- 💾 Appointments are stored in **localStorage** (persist after reload)  
- 📋 Displays a list of all upcoming appointments  
- ⚠️ Prevents booking duplicate **date + time** slots  
- ❌ Allows appointments to be **canceled** (removed from list and storage)

---

## 🚫 What It Doesn’t Do (Yet)
- ❌ No backend or shared database (data stays in your browser only)  
- ❌ No authentication (any visitor can add/cancel)  
- ❌ No recurring appointments or advanced conflict detection  
- ❌ Doesn’t handle time zones or working-hour limits  

---

## 🔮 Next Steps
- 🕓 Replace free-form time entry with selectable **available slots**  
- 📧 Add **email confirmations** for bookings  
- 🎨 Improve styling and UX (calendar view, slot grids, animations)
