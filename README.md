# 🌐 Web Dev Fun

Here be the remains of web dev projects I tried — small experiments, half-built ideas, and random front-end tinkering.  
This repo is a sandbox for learning, creativity, and playful exploration.

## 📌 What’s Inside
- Mini-sites and prototypes  
- UI/UX experiments  
- JavaScript snippets  
- Random design tests  

Each project lives in its own folder. Some are polished, some are just sketches — all are for fun and learning.
