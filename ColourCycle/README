# ðŸŽ¨ ColorCycle

**Tier: 1 â€” Beginner**

ColorCycle is a simple web app that demonstrates how small changes in RGB values affect color and, in turn, user interface and user experience (UI/UX).  
It allows users to experiment with color transitions by starting with a chosen color and applying gradual changes over time.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
- Users specify a starting fill color using a standard **6-digit CSS hex code** (`#RRGGBB`).
- The app displays a box filled with this color and modifies it based on user-defined increments.
- Every **0.25 seconds**, the chosen increments are added to the RGB components, creating a smooth color shift.
- The effect helps users better understand the **visual impact of tweaking RGB values** in real time.
