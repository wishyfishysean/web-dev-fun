# ðŸ”® The Archive of Forgotten Futures

A web-based interactive archive exploring **futures that could have been but never came to pass**.  
Visitors uncover branching timelines, salvaged fragments, and surreal hybrid worlds through an immersive, retro-futuristic interface.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Concept
The Archive acts as a living, shifting record of alternate histories and speculative futures.  
It blends **storytelling, interactivity, and design** into a space that feels part **mystical star chart**, part **broken starship terminal**.

## Please note
This single HTML file uses Tailwind CSS for all styling and a simple JavaScript script to handle the dynamic content. 
When you click "Travel Beyond," it displays one of several pre-defined alternate futures, complete with a story and fragments. 
The "Salvage Fragments" and "Dream Generator" buttons will manipulate the content on the page, 
simulating the more complex features you requested.

The retro-futuristic aesthetic is created using a dark color scheme, a monospace font, glowing text, and terminal-like borders. 
The layout is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
