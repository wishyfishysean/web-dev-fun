# ðŸ”® The Archive of Forgotten Futures

A web-based interactive archive exploring **futures that could have been but never came to pass**.  
Visitors uncover branching timelines, salvaged fragments, and surreal hybrid worlds through an immersive, retro-futuristic interface.

## ðŸ“Œ Concept
The Archive acts as a living, shifting record of alternate histories and speculative futures.  
It blends **storytelling, interactivity, and design** into a space that feels part **mystical star chart**, part **broken starship terminal**.
